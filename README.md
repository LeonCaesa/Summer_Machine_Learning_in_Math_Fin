# Summer_Machine_Learning_in_Math_Fin
                                                ---------Project in progross---------

Created to share python srcipts among Ge and Georgie.

### Data Preparation

Data is shared from google drive within project members, mainly followed the approaches by Jeremiah Green, The Characteristics that Provide Independent Information about Average U.S. Monthly Stock Returns (2011)

Data needs to be stored in the ./Data/ Directory in order for the data_cleaning.ipynb to run.

### Current Progross
  1. We sucessfully modified and implemented the SAS codes collecting data from WRDS.

  2. We cleaned the data by interpolating the missing values and check distribution [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/LeonCaesa/Summer_Machine_Learning_in_Math_Fin/blob/master/data_cleaning/data_cleanning.ipynb).

  3. I mainly implemented Random Forest Methods here available at (Jupyter Notebook[https://github.com/LeonCaesa/Summer_Machine_Learning_in_Math_Fin/blob/master/Random_Forest.ipynb]
